Because I started this assignment a bit late, so I wasn't able to work with my classmates or to attend office hours. My initial impression about java is that it has a quite different syntax from Python which I was more farmiliar to. When I was working on this assignment, it takes some time to fix the syntax. For the difference between the two languages, I think java is more explicit in terms of declaring variable types. One advice from me is to start assignments early and talk to people for initial thinking, which I believe will be easier.
